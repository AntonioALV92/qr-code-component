## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS BEM methodology
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - Font
- Git Conventional Commits

### What I learned

I learned how to better use the CSS BEM methodology, in this case it was a small project but it's a good implementation.

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) sintax:
- `[block]`
- `[block]__[element]`
- `[block]--[modifier]`
- `[element]--[modifier]`
- `[block]__[element]--[modifier]`

Use example:
```html
<div class="card">
  <img class="card__image" src="..." alt="...">
  <div class="card__content">
    <h2 class="card__title">...</h2>
    <p class="card__description">...</p>
  </div>
</div>
```
```css
.card {}
.card__image {}
.card__content {}
.card__title {}
.card__description {}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on in future projects about how to use git command `git pull --rebase origin main` for refine and perfect my knowledge.
